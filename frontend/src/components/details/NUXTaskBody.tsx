            Welcome to General Task! We’ve created a few sample tasks to help you get a feel for things.
            <p>
                First up, we have Task-to-Calendar. This helps you get your tasks done by setting aside time for them on
                your calendar. Try dragging this task to the calendar on the right to give it a shot — any tasks you
                drag will appear on your Google Calendar.
            </p>
            <p>
                Next, we’ll take a look at how to shut out distractions with Focus Mode. Click the checkbox to mark this
                task as done whenever you’re ready.
            </p>

            Distractions can make it difficult to get things done, so we’ve created Focus Mode to help you keep your
            attention on the things you care about. To use it, click Enter Focus Mode to immerse yourself in one thing
            at a time. Any events on your calendar will take center stage, including tasks you’ve put there using
            Task-to-Calendar. This way, you’ll have easy access to task details, and can join meetings in just one
            click.
            <p>
                If you don’t have anything planned on your calendar, Focus Mode can also help you decide what to work on
                next. This way, you can leave it open throughout your day and always have a clear sense of what to work
                on next.
            </p>
            <p>
                Pro tip: Try pinning this tab in your browser for easy access, or keep it on a second monitor to get
                details about your day at a quick glance.

        <p>
            Thank you for choosing General Task! We know that there are many productivity solutions on the market, and
            we are truly honored that you landed on us.
        </p>
        <p>
            We have spent the last year building what we believe to be the best productivity solution on the market for
            software engineers. And it’s free! We don’t limit our software to those who can afford to pay $30+/month,
            like many of our competitors do. At General Task, we believe that everyone, not just a select few, should
            have access to the very best productivity tools and services. That means we will be keeping our personal
            productivity solution <b>free forever</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Productivity is close to our hearts. Our team has worked at some of the most successful companies in the
            industry: Meta, Netflix, LinkedIn, Robinhood, as well as many other smaller companies. We learned a lot and
            had a good time, but we also saw the downside of working at such companies: pointless meetings, constant
            distractions and waiting way too long to get your code reviewed, among many other issues.
        </p>
        <p>
            We know how crappy it can feel to have an unproductive day and how awesome it can feel to be super
            productive day. We want to make those awesome days happen all the time. That’s why we built this. We use
            General Task in-house daily, and we are already seeing substantial improvements in our own productivity. It
            feels great. We hope you enjoy the tool as much as we do!
        </p>
        <p>
            General Task, as it is currently available, is in beta. This means that it is an imperfect work in progress,
            but will improve rapidly to help you be more and more productive over time. We are just getting started, and
            we can’t wait to have you along for the ride.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>But we can’t do this alone!</b>
        </p>
        <p>
            We are committed to listening to each and every one of your ideas, and will work tirelessly to improve our
            software as much as possible, as fast as possible. Please send us any bugs you notice, or product ideas
            you’d like to see in the app. Anything helps!
        </p>
