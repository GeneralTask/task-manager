# Metrics
A space for metrics and data analysis

## Daily User Metrics
We have a lightweight web app that generates daily user activity metrics. Build and run with `docker-compose down && docker-compose up -d` then go to `localhost:8050` to see the app. Note we must have the following environment variables set: `DASH_USER`, `DASH_PASSWORD`, `MONGO_USER`, `MONGO_PASSWORD`
